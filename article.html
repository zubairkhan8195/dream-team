                                <p class="text-lg text-primary-700 font-normal font-pop pt-4">Here are our ever-evolving learnings for organizations to move fast – more shots on goal – and stay lean – more shots per person – at any scale. There’s a lot of fluff and snake oil out there on how to improve team effectiveness. We’ve found these lessons are repeatedly the most impactful, based on years of studying, partnering with, or working at companies like Shopify, Snap, Amazon, and Gusto.</p>
                                <p class="text-lg text-primary-700 font-normal font-pop pt-4">To help unleash that encumbered innovation, we built a tool called <span class="text-primary-100">KATA</span>. It makes adopting these learnings easy, without changing any of the tools or processes you already use. We’d love for you to check it out!</p>

                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-700 font-pop font-normal pt-4">In a lot of ways Agile has really jumped the shark. Don’t take our word for it though, ask one of its creators. The Agile Manifesto core value of “Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools” ran right into the SaaS-plosion we’re living in today. The rise of task management masquerading as project management really did a number on “Responding to Change over Following a Plan.” And then came the frameworks. If you ask Google, there are more than 50 known Agile Frameworks (SCRUM, KanBan, etc.), not to mention the new scaling frameworks (SAFe, Scrum@Scale etc). We think it's high time to get back to first principles – and that is what we advocate for here in our anti-framework for Getting $#*! Done at Scale.</p>

                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-700 font-pop font-normal pt-4" >If we put the frameworks, goal methodologies, and task management tools aside – what are we left with? At the core, we do projects. And they’re done by a team of people. We have found that stripping away the jargon and process, and focusing on getting really good at the fundamentals, goes a long way toward improving productivity. In this case, that means helping people get really good at executing projects. In fact, that’s why we named our first product KATA. Japanese for “form,” KATA is commonly used in martial arts to refer to practicing fundamentals to achieve overall mastery</p>

Moving fast at scale means ensuring large groups of people are spending their effort on the highest value items – to do work that matters – in concert with one another, in complex systems. You don’t just need raw speed. You need velocity: speed AND direction. Otherwise you run the risk of going really quickly in the wrong direction(s) and ending up in the wrong place. This is where projects come in.</p>

                        <p  class="text-lg text-primary-900 font-pop font-normal pt-4">Chess is a beautiful game of decision-making and strategy, of clear rules and complete information. If you’re a skilled player, there’s no betting in chess because there’s little to no luck involved.</p>
                        <p  class="text-lg text-primary-900 font-pop font-normal pt-4">Eliminate wasted effort by focusing a project on achieving an outcome, rather than getting a bunch of tasks done. This focus gives your team the guidance and autonomy they need to decide if a task is actually worth doing.</p>
                        <p  class="text-lg text-primary-900 font-pop font-normal pt-4">When you focus on achieving an outcome – rather than a poorly estimated ship date – and pair it with thinking in bets, you are in a better position to assess tradeoffs and potential return on effort, or ROE. You can then match your appetite for investment with the potential outcomes, and place your bets accordingly.</p>
                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-900 font-pop font-normal pt-4">When reframed as bets, you suddenly realize that projects can’t be approached as a fixed set of things to do – aka. tasks – to achieve a known outcome. This is especially true in the case of software development. Instead, projects should be viewed as establishing a bet on a desired outcome with recognition that you are in an ever-changing environment with incomplete information. Acknowledging this reality upfront lets the team see shortcuts and optimizations they’d otherwise miss in blind pursuit of task completion.</p>

                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-900 font-pop font-normal pt-4">The popularity of task management tools makes it easy to mistake speed for velocity. Look at all these tickets we’re closing! But are we moving the needle on our overall business objectives? Are we generating an impact for our customers?</p>
                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-900 font-pop font-normal pt-4">Unfortunately, real life is never that straightforward. As Annie Duke states in her popular book, Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts, “Chess, for all its strategic complexity, isn’t a great model for decision-making in life, where most of our decisions involve hidden information and a much greater influence of luck.”</p>
                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-900 font-pop font-normal pt-4">Environments shift, information is incomplete, and there’s no perfect way to play. Every decision becomes a bet. And projects are the bets organizations make – how we decide to apply our finite resources and people to increase productivity.</p>
                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-900 font-pop font-normal pt-4">This shift in focus is powerful. Not only will you save wasted effort and find shortcuts along your way, but it lets you say “no” to more projects upfront, avoiding even more wasted effort.</p>

                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-700 font-pop font-normal pt-4 ">It's a subtle but important mental shift. ROI is a financial term. But more often than not, we aren’t making financial investments with projects. Instead, we’re allocating people’s time and energy, which means we’re investing effort. So, Return on Effort. Why does this distinction matter? Well, the math is different. Sure, time is money and all that. But people are not resources. When you invest $100 and want to double your investment you invest $100 more.</p>
                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-700 font-pop font-normal pt-4 xl:pt-0">Asking people to work twice as hard yields variable results. You may get more or less than twice the effort depending on how you ask. And doubling the people – well, projects don't work like that. If you remember that we make investment decisions not with algebra, but multivariable calculus, you’ll go a long way toward better upfront decision making and appetite assessment.</p>

                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-700 font-pop font-normal pt-4 xl:pt-4">It’s called Parkinson’s Law for a reason. We’ve all experienced the phenomenon of work expanding to fill the time available for its completion. So projects MUST have a target ship date, right?</p>
                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-700 font-pop font-normal pt-4">But we all recognize that projects evolve as they go. As we make progress, we gain new information, which alters our course. We rarely know the entire path forward when we start, but, we do know the concrete next step, or milestone, we’re working towards. Hitting these milestones pull us closer to achieving our overall objectives.</p>
                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-700 font-pop font-normal pt-4">By tracking milestones – smaller, higher confidence, interim goals – you keep Parkinson’s Law at bay. This lets you subdivide the entropy for lower project risk overall, and accumulate small victories that build confidence and momentum.</p>

                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-700 font-pop font-normal pt-9 xl:pt-4">The most productive way to write and set milestones is in the language of your project’s end-users, articulating what is being achieved or delivered. For product development, use product functionality language. For technical projects, use technical deliverables. Using appropriate terminology better enables your team to connect the project management goals to the progress being made. For example, communicating when a new feature will be launched is more helpful than knowing that the “back-end is complete.”</p>
                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-700 font-pop font-normal pt-4">Status updates should then cover progress towards achieving both these milestones as well as the overall project outcome.</p>

While that sentiment certainly carries some weight, other folks need to be in the know so they can successfully complete their own projects within the larger objective. Marketing and sales need to be ready to communicate with customers while Customer Ops needs to be prepared to support the customer. Setting milestones with target dates that are visible to the entire organization is a great way to keep dependent teams informed. Perhaps even more importantly, this practice builds trust, and increases the odds of your overall project success. Consider this – if users are never told about a new feature, or a new capability is never sold, did it ever really happen?</p>

                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-700 font-pop font-normal pt-4">It’s no secret, people want to do work that matters. The more you can connect your project to why it matters, the more motivated your team will be, and the better decisions they’ll make. Objectives alone aren’t enough.</p>
                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-700 font-pop font-normal pt-4">Consider this example: suppose you operate a social platform and you want to add games to it. Your overall Objective, in the OKR sense, might be to “build a world-class casual gaming platform” for your audience. So your team goes off to build a world-class casual gaming platform. One project they define might be to add a portal for game-makers to publish games. Sensical.</p>
                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-700 font-pop font-normal pt-4">But what if your strategy were to create a limited number of blockbuster games rather than to offer a broad catalog? Your team would be doing a lot of needless work crafting a world-class publishing portal when you really just needed a basic platform to host a handful of games. They were missing the why, the intent of the Objective, the strategy.</p>

                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-700 font-pop font-normal pt-4">We’ve seen that an effective way to make this connection is by writing and sharing a Project Brief. The purpose of this document is to drive alignment and consensus about the objective of a project before any effort is spent. In addition to covering what a project is, a Project Brief should also outline the bet it’s undertaking, why it makes sense, and how it relates to the overall strategy. This document should be shared broadly across the project team, not just consumed by leadership and product management.</p>

                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-700 font-pop font-normal pt-4 pb-14 lg:pb-0">Build a culture of action-driven updates that stand on their own. Encourage team members and project owners to ask themselves “so what?” when providing check-ins and status updates. If something is on track, what’s working and is there an opportunity to go faster? If something is off track, what’s the issue and what is your plan to address it? The more automatic the behavior, the more automatic the continuous improvement.</p>

                <p class="text-lg text-primary-900  font-pop font-normal pt-8 xl:pt-[42px]">Moving fast means not wasting effort, which allows for more shots on goal. Moving fast at scale means ensuring large groups of people are spending their effort on the highest value items – to do work that matters – in concert with one another, in complex systems. You don’t just need raw speed. You need velocity: speed AND direction. Otherwise you run the risk of going really quickly in the wrong direction(s) and ending up in the wrong place. This is where projects come in.</p>

                <p class="text-lg text-primary-900 font-pop font-normal pt-4">Create a single source of truth for all of the projects in progress across the organization. With limited exceptions, this project directory should be accessible to everyone – from the interns, to the CEO – so information can flow freely. This interconnectivity requires more than just a project name listed on a spreadsheet.</p>
                <p class="text-lg text-primary-900 font-pop font-normal pt-4">The project directory should clearly communicate why each project is important, how each project is going, and how much effort (people) is being applied. This level of companywide transparency enables everyone to stay tuned in and leadership to more confidently make trade-off decisions.</p>

                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-900 font-pop font-normal pt-4">Let your teams select the tools and ceremonies that work best for them. Teams are like people: no two are alike and they change over time. Forcing teams into unnatural ceremonies or undesired tools just adds friction – it makes them stop and think. Standardizing communication, on the other hand, enables information to flow freely while teams are free to work how they choose and collaborate more effectively.</p>
                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-900 font-pop font-normal pt-4">Establish a standard language for talking about projects and a social protocol to actually use it. Beyond tracking milestones, we have found that regularly sharing demos and check-ins from team members, as well as keeping a written decision log, go an incredibly long way to staying in sync, asynchronously.</p>

                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-900 font-pop font-normal pt-4">Sprints provide a helpful example. Some teams prefer two-week cycles, others six. Some projects have fixed shipping schedules, such as app store updates, and some have arbitrary dates.</p>
                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-900 font-pop font-normal pt-4">Sprints are great at scheduling and coordinating tasks and should be flexible to match the actual work the team is doing. But sprints tell you little about progress. You need to standardize how you talk about progress.</p>

                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-900 font-pop font-normal pt-8 lg:pt-0">Think of projects like a jazz performance. It may be the same song, but no two performances sound the same. What makes jazz special (and hard!) is its improvisational format, its artistic autonomy. Jazz artists riff and jam in real time. This works because in addition to their strong functional skills, each musician knows how to communicate (through active listening) with each other as they play and adapt on the fly to what they’re hearing.</p>
                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-900 font-pop font-normal pt-4">Projects are the same way. When we share a common language, and have mechanisms in place to hear each other, we can build on each other's riffs and deliver stellar performances as a group. Usually, it’s just not the performance we originally planned on delivering.</p>
                        <p class="text-lg text-primary-900 font-pop font-normal pt-4 pb-14 xxl:pb-0">Keep the autonomy, standardize communication to bring strategic alignment.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-primary-700 font-pop lg:text-center font-normal pt-4">While frequent sharing and feedback should be encouraged, team members and stakeholders must also understand how to best support the team. Dissecting copy on early designs is not productive, and neither is questioning the approach to solving a problem right as it’s about to ship.</p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-primary-700 font-pop lg:text-center font-normal pt-4">So focus the feedback by sharing which phase the project is in. Teammates should then deliver feedback appropriate to the level of project maturity.
